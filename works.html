							<p>Measuring the value of a designer can be found in the final product. However, knowing the designer's ablity to overcome challenges in the project and access resources outside the box can help explain the designer's overall apptitude for consistancy and rate of success.</p>

							<p>Adrian has included three projects for your review.  Each project includes: the backdrop to the project, the requirements, the intial itteration, and the final product.</p>

							<h2>Task</h2>

							<p>After a long hiatus due to Covid-19, live music is back— and that's great news for designers.  The assignment for project 3 aims to develop your individual voices as illustrators, by probing the functional, expressive, and aesthetic possibilities (and limitations) of the poster. For the third project of the semester, you will design a promotional concert poster for an artist or band of your choosing. The poster design must be for an upcoming concert in 2022  (not a concert prior to April 2022), and it must advertise the band, show, and venue to the artist's existing audience.</p>

							<aside>
								<h2>Requirements</h2>

								<ul>
									<li>Final poster must be created in Adobe Illustrator </li>
									<li>Poster should be sized/printed at 11x17 inches (portrait/vertical orientation)
									Poster can be designed in color or b/w</li>
									<li>Designers may incorporate a variety of mediums (drawings, painting, hi-resolution photography, etc) but there must be vector art in the piece.</li>
									<li>4Poster must include the concert date, concert time, artist/band name, the name of the venue, city/location</li>
									<li>Dimensions to be 11x17</li>
									<li>Book must include the work of every student (yourself included) and 4 collages per student must be featured alongside images credits</li>
									<li>Poster should contain crop marks and bleeds</li>
									<li>If using a photograph to trace or to use as reference material for a vector illustration,  the source image must be from the artist's website, record label, or Instagram page to avoid copyright infringement.</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Response</h2>
							<p>Adrian addressed the task by first considering the music, band, and consumer.  Ticket prices for this show started at $300 US dollars.  That says the show is in high demand, and the demand is from a large but specific group of loyal fans.  Determining the consumer group helped define if there was already a model in place for "posters" with that group.  That model was is almost exculsively completed by illustrators with a grungy appeal packed full of details and hints of the performance location.</p>
							<p>Adrian wanted to make the illustration compel the viewer, and then use the illustration to compel the viewers eye to the neccissary information.  After a mockups and revised itterations, Adrian concludes with a product that is inline with what he wanted and what the requirements asked.  The product strikes the eye and compels the viewer for a closer look.  The poster is fluid, easy to read, and meets the clients requirements.</p>

							<h2>Task</h2>

							<p>For the creative project, you will be tasked with curating a selection of collages from your peers, and creating an art book using that work as the content. This book will highlight each artist's work, akin to a coffee-table book, or a picture book. Your challenge will be to select thematically-related collages, and to then design a book that not only showcases the work of your peers, but also hints at larger themes you have noticed emerging.</p>

							<aside>
								<h2>Requirements</h2>

								<ul>
									<li>Book must be designed in Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator</li>
									<li>Book must be a minimum of 40 pages</li>
									<li>Book must be perfect bound</li>
									<li>40-65# paper stock recommended for interior pages, 110# cover stock recommended for cover</li>
									<li>Dimensions to be 11x17</li>
									<li>Book must include the work of every student (yourself included) and 4 collages per student must be featured alongside images credits</li>
									<li>Book must include a forward</li>
									<li>Book must include a table of contents</li>

							<h2>Response</h2>
							<p>Adrian addressed the task by creating a creative collective for both he and his colleagues: SQUIB.  SQUIB is all about community, rules, and knowing when to break the rules.  Adrian Anderton designed SQUIB with mixed media, negative space, and a clear desire to design SQUIB in a manner to accentuate the artists of it's collective.</p>

							<h2>Background/Overview</h2>

							<p>A new adult-use cannabis dispensary will be opening in the fall of 2023 in Nevada City, CA and the business needs a name and identity. Unlike other dispensaries around the nation, this dispensary will have an ethical approach and will operate as a non-profit organization. The dispensary's mission is to serve as a charitable foundation, with all profits being redirected into the community and solely funding other non-profits in the region through a system of grants. The founders of the dispensary see this as is a regenerative cycle of support that will help sustain other organizations that are doing good work in the community.</p>

									<li>Develop a name for the dispensary that speaks to it's mission</li>
									<li>Design a logo for the dispensary</li>
									<li>Create a package design for the dispensary</li>
									<li>Design an app icon for the mobile app</li>
